In this commit, we create scripts where 
we can run 'npm start' --> production mode
and 'npm run dev' --> development mode

We haven't created any routes so that's Why
we get 404 status error in this version
---------
It seems that npm start overrides config file info, so NODE_ENV = production 
instead of development

------------------------
Route structures (can change in the fuuture):

/api/v1/emails
/api/v1/headers
/api/v1/reviews
/api/v1/auth
/api/v1/users

---------Middleware:
Middleware functions that are called inside other middleware will 
not be called by the primary app that is calling the middleware
E.g.: function in routes/emails.js will not be called in the server.js
but will only be called in the routes/emails.js dir (??).

--> examples: custom logging middleware (console.log with different req
attributes)
