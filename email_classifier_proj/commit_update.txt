In this commit, we create scripts where 
we can run 'npm start' --> production mode
and 'npm run dev' --> development mode

We haven't created any routes so that's Why
we get 404 status error in this version
---------
It seems that npm start overrides config file info, so NODE_ENV = production 
instead of development

------------------------
Route structures (can change in the fuuture):

/api/v1/emails
/api/v1/headers
/api/v1/reviews
/api/v1/auth
/api/v1/users
